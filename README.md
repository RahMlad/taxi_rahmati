# Description
**[Taxi Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.misour.taxi_notes)** is an Android App for taking notes of cab trips. In particular, the focus of the app was on **medical trips**, as these must be logged by every cab driver. Taxi Notes allows users to save and print their trips. Attributes of saved trips will be highlighted on the formular to ease the process of adding new rides.

# Implementation
**[Flutter]()** was used to implement the app. The **[Bloc pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/)** was used as state management while also applying **[Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)** principles to create a scalable and maintainable application.
